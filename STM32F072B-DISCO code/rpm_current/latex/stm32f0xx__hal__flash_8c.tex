                      ##### FLASH peripheral features #####
==============================================================================
[..] The Flash memory interface manages CPU AHB I-Code and D-Code accesses 
     to the Flash memory. It implements the erase and program Flash memory operations 
     and the read and write protection mechanisms.

[..] The Flash memory interface accelerates code execution with a system of instruction
    prefetch. 

[..] The FLASH main features are:
    (+) Flash memory read operations
    (+) Flash memory program/erase operations
    (+) Read / write protections
    (+) Prefetch on I-Code
    (+) Option Bytes programming


                   ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]                             
    This driver provides functions and macros to configure and program the FLASH 
    memory of all STM32F0xx devices.
  
    (#) FLASH Memory I/O Programming functions: this group includes all needed
        functions to erase and program the main memory:
      (++) Lock and Unlock the FLASH interface
      (++) Erase function: Erase page, erase all pages
      (++) Program functions: half word, word and doubleword
    (#) FLASH Option Bytes Programming functions: this group includes all needed
        functions to manage the Option Bytes:
      (++) Lock and Unlock the Option Bytes
      (++) Set/Reset the write protection
      (++) Set the Read protection Level
      (++) Program the user Option Bytes
      (++) Launch the Option Bytes loader
      (++) Erase Option Bytes
      (++) Program the data Option Bytes
      (++) Get the Write protection.
      (++) Get the user option bytes.
  
    (#) Interrupts and flags management functions : this group 
        includes all needed functions to:
      (++) Handle FLASH interrupts
      (++) Wait for last FLASH operation according to its status
      (++) Get error flag status

[..] In addition to these function, this driver includes a set of macros allowing
     to handle the following operations:
    
    (+) Set/Get the latency
    (+) Enable/Disable the prefetch buffer
    (+) Enable/Disable the FLASH interrupts
    (+) Monitor the FLASH flags status\end{DoxyVerb}
