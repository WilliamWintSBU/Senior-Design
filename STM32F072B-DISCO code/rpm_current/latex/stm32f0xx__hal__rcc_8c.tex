                    ##### RCC specific features #####
==============================================================================
  [..]  
    After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator
    (HSI 8MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer is disabled, 
    and all peripherals are off except internal SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
    (+) There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) buses;
        all peripherals mapped on these buses are running at HSI speed.
    (+) The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
    (+) All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
        are assigned to be used for debug purpose.
  [..] Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:
    (+) Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
        (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
    (+) Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings  
    (+) Configure the AHB and APB buses prescalers
    (+) Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
    (+) Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals whose clocks are not
        derived from the System clock (RTC, ADC, I2C, USART, TIM, USB FS, etc..)

                    ##### RCC Limitations #####
==============================================================================
  [..]  
    A delay between an RCC peripheral clock enable and the effective peripheral 
    enabling should be taken into account in order to manage the peripheral read/write 
    from/to registers.
    (+) This delay depends on the peripheral mapping.
      (++) AHB & APB peripherals, 1 dummy read is necessary

  [..]  
    Workarounds:
    (#) For AHB & APB peripherals, a dummy read to the peripheral register has been
        inserted in each __HAL_RCC_PPP_CLK_ENABLE() macro.\end{DoxyVerb}
