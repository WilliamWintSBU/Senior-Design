Macros to enable or disable the Internal 48Mhz High Speed oscillator (HSI48). 

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The HSI48 is stopped by hardware when entering STOP and STANDBY modes. 

HSI48 can not be stopped if it is used as system clock source. In this case, you have to select another source of the system clock then stop the HSI14. 

After enabling the HSI48 with \+\_\+\+\_\+\+HAL\+\_\+\+RCC\+\_\+\+HSI48\+\_\+\+ENABLE(), the application software should wait on HSI48\+RDY flag to be set indicating that HSI48 clock is stable and can be used as system clock source. This is not necessary if \mbox{\hyperlink{group___r_c_c___exported___functions___group1_ga9c504088722e03830df6caad932ad06b}{HAL\+\_\+\+RCC\+\_\+\+Osc\+Config()}} is used. 

When the HSI48 is stopped, HSI48\+RDY flag goes low after 6 HSI48 oscillator clock cycles.
